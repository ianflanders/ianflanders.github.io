		<p>My name is Ian Flanders, I'm 16 years old, and I live in Ewa Beach, Hawaii. I go to James Campbell Highschool , I am a junior, and I play for the school's varsity football team. I am a military kid who has moved to several places. I lived in Maryland, Virginia, Spain, and I live in Hawaii. I want to go to college and become a mechanical engineer, but if I can I want to make music for a living. I am a very good student who gets A's and B's and I take AP courses. I have many interests in things such as engineering, robotics, coding, video games, fasion, jewerly, music, and politics. </p>
